# Spell Effects Fix Summary

## Issues Found:
1. **clearExpiredEffects spam** - Client keeps calling this even though it was removed from BoardgamePvP.jsx (likely cached/old state)
2. **Effect type detection broken** - Effects showing as 'default' instead of 'pyroblast'/'ice_nova'
3. **Two separate spell systems** - castSpell and useAbility not consistent
4. **Effects not syncing between players** - G.activeEffects not properly triggering client updates
5. **Proxy revocation error** - setTimeout in game.js trying to access G after proxy revoked, crashing server

## Root Causes:
1. The ultimate ability (index 2) is stored in card.ultimateAbility not card.abilities[2]
2. Effect type detection uses ability.id which doesn't exist (should use ability.name)
3. The sync system is overly complex with processedEffectsRef
4. boardgame.io doesn't trigger React re-renders for nested array changes

## How We Fixed It:

### Server Stability Fix:
Removed the setTimeout in game.js that was causing proxy revocation errors. The setTimeout was attempting to clean up G.activeEffects after the game state proxy had been revoked, crashing the server.

### Spell Effects Sync Fix:
1. **Added explicit tracking variables** (`effectsCount` and `latestEffectId`) to force React to detect when G.activeEffects changes
2. **Implemented backup polling mechanism** (500ms interval) that checks for unprocessed effects and ensures they render on both clients
3. **Fixed ultimate ability detection** - Now correctly checks card.ultimateAbility for index 2
4. **Normalized effect type detection** - Uses ability.name.toLowerCase() to properly identify 'pyroblast' and 'ice_nova'

### Performance Optimization:
- Reduced cleanup interval from 100ms to 1000ms
- Changed processed effects cleanup from 100ms to 2000ms
- These changes reduced excessive state updates that were causing lag

## Fixed:
- ✅ Server stability - no more proxy revocation crashes
- ✅ Effect type detection - correctly shows 'pyroblast' and 'ice_nova'
- ✅ Spell effects sync - both players now see effects
- ✅ Performance - reduced lag from excessive intervals

## Known Issues:
- Animation jitter/incomplete playback - may be due to multiple state updates or duration mismatches
