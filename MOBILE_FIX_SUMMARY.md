# Mobile Disconnection Fix Summary

## Root Cause
- Three.js/WebGL was overwhelming mobile browsers during initialization, causing memory crashes
- Mobile Safari/Phantom have strict memory limits that triggered page reloads
- Wallet disconnects were side effects, not the primary issue

## Key Fixes Applied

### Memory Management
- Added React Suspense lazy-loading for 3D assets
- Skip loading decorative GLB models on mobile
- Implemented WebGL context loss recovery
- Show loading progress to prevent perceived freezes

### Connection Stability
- Socket.IO: polling-first transport + exponential backoff
- Extended timeouts: 2min connection, 60s ping
- 10 reconnection attempts with visual feedback
- Prevent wallet disconnects from triggering reloads

### Result
âœ… Mobile devices can now maintain stable PvP connections without crashing
