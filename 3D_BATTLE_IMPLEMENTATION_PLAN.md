### State Management
```javascript
// Battle state structure
{
  playerTeam: [...characters],
  enemyTeam: [...characters],
  currentTurn: 'player',
  activeCharacterIndex: 0,
  turnOrder: [...],
  isTargeting: false,
  selectedAbility: null,
  validTargets: [...],
  battleStatus: 'active', // 'active', 'victory', 'defeat'
  effects: {
    shields: Map(),
    statuses: Map(),
    buffs: Map(),
    debuffs: Map()
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Systems (Current)
- Health bars and damage numbers
- Basic turn system
- Essential abilities

### Phase 2: Full Combat
- All character abilities
- Complete targeting system
- Status effects

### Phase 3: Polish
- Animations and particles
- Sound effects
- Victory/defeat screens

### Phase 4: Integration
- Connect to game progression
- Save/load battles
- Multiplayer support

## 📝 Code References

### Key Files to Reference:
- **AutoBattleScreen.jsx** - Complete 2D battle logic
- **CharacterCard.jsx** - Character display and stats
- **DamageNumber.jsx** - Damage number animations
- **enhancedCharacters.js** - All character abilities
- **ImagePyroblastEffect.jsx** - 2D spell effect reference
- **ImageIceNovaEffect.jsx** - 2D ice effect reference

### Important Functions to Port:
```javascript
// From AutoBattleScreen.jsx
- executeAbility()
- handleDamage()
- handleHealing()
- checkBattleEnd()

```

## 🎮 Testing Checklist
- [ ] All abilities work correctly
- [ ] Damage calculations accurate
- [ ] Turn order follows speed stats
- [ ] Targeting only allows valid targets
- [ ] Status effects apply/remove properly
- [ ] Victory/defeat conditions trigger
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Performance (60fps desktop, 30fps mobile)

## 🐛 Known Issues to Fix
- Audio files missing (pyroblast.wav, explosion.wav, etc.)
- Need to optimize particle effects for mobile
- Coordinate system needs documentation

## 📚 Resources Needed
- Sound effect files for abilities
- Victory/defeat music
- Particle textures for new effects
- Icons for abilities UI

## 🚀 Next Session Starting Point
**Continue with Health Bar implementation:**
1. Create HealthBar3D.jsx component
2. Integrate with Battle3DTest.jsx
3. Add smooth animations for damage/healing
4. Test with damage dealing functions
