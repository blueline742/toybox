# Contractor Verification Checklist for raz914

## GitHub Profile Check
- [ ] Check contribution graph (should show consistent activity)
- [ ] Look at actual code in repositories (not just README files)
- [ ] Verify the portfolio sites match code in his repos
- [ ] Check if commits are meaningful (not just "update" repeatedly)
- [ ] See if he has any Three.js/R3F projects

## Technical Test Questions (Ask these):
1. "How would you optimize Three.js performance for mobile?"
2. "What's the difference between instanceId and id in our card system?"
3. "How would you handle spell animations syncing between players?"

## Red Flags to Watch For:
- ❌ Only forked repos, no original work
- ❌ Commits all on same day (fake history)
- ❌ No JavaScript/React projects
- ❌ Code style drastically different from portfolio

## Safe Testing Approach:
1. Give him ONE specific bug to fix first ($50)
   - Example: "Fix the turn timer not ending properly after Pyroblast"
2. See how he:
   - Communicates the problem
   - Proposes the solution
   - Implements the fix
   - Documents the change

## Payment Safety:
- Use PayPal Goods & Services (has buyer protection)
- Or use Fiverr (they hold money in escrow)
- NEVER use crypto or "Friends & Family" payment
- NEVER pay full amount upfront

## Questions to Ask:
1. "Can you show me React Three Fiber code you've written?"
2. "Which of those portfolio sites has the most complex 3D work?"
3. "Have you worked with boardgame.io before?"
4. "What's your approach to debugging multiplayer sync issues?"
